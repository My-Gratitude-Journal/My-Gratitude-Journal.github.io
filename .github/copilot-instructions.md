# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be newly initialized or empty. No source files, documentation, or project structure were detected. As such, there are no established architectural patterns, workflows, or conventions to document at this time.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Before making changes, check with the user for the intended project type, language, and goals.
- If you are tasked with project setup, follow best practices for initializing new projects (e.g., create a README, set up version control, and establish a basic directory structure).
- When adding files, prefer clear, conventional naming and organization (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `README.md`).
- If the user provides additional context or files, update this document to reflect new patterns, workflows, or conventions as they emerge.

## Next Steps
- Revisit and update these instructions as the codebase evolves.
- If you are the first to add code, set the tone for structure and documentation.
